However, they rape those who do trespass on their lands. Though they use the pretext of punishment, in most cases it’s done for their own pleasure and enjoyment, or even for reproduction. Their sexual skills are very potent; the Queen Elf's power is said to rival a succubus's. Normal elves are vegetarians and do not normally eat semen. However, if they do develop a taste for semen, they go through a process called Degeneration, becoming a dark elf. Dark elves are are generally more aggressive, even more sadistic, have an even greater libido, and are rendered incapable of reproduction. Dark elves are known to corrupt men by using their infamous Kiss of Ecstasy skill to drown him in pleasure and then force him to ejaculate. Once a man gives in to their pleasure, he becomes corrupted just like the dark elf, forgetting everything except pleasure. When this happens, the man may single-mindedly have sex with the dark elf to the point where he may die.

Due to this it is quite disconnected from the rest of the world, resulting in its inhabitants having an unusual outlook on life. Being somewhat set apart from the rest of the world, the population of the village don’t seem to know about the Ilias faith. Instead, their religion is more based on the folklore which surrounds the monsters. Certain kinds of monsters are worshipped to the extent that the humans in the village have built shrines for them. These monsters are referred to by their animal basis rather than their species name: kitsune being named \"Mighty Fox\", lamias as \"Mighty Snake\" and Nekomatas as \"Mighty Cat\". The worship is so ingrained that such monsters are always referred to formally and with the utmost respect. Even showing an inch of malice towards any of these monsters is frowned upon and is considered to be folly. Generally the shrines house their respective monsters if they are present. Tamamo of the Four Heavenly Knights also hails from this village, and she likes frequenting the Fox Shrine to bask in the attention and be treated to her beloved fried tofu. Other folklore revolves around monsters such as the Yuki-onna and the dreaded Yamata no Orochi, the latter demanding a sacrifice every year to be delivered in her cave. Towards the end of Luka's stay in the village, Yamata no Orochi is sealed and taken care of in the Snake Shrine to reflect on her actions.]",

In general the Succubi who live outside of Hellgondo live in disguise to avoid persecution from followers of the Goddess Ilias. Notable members are the current queen, Alma Elma, the legendary queens from 500 years ago, Lilith & Lilim, and the Six Ancestor and progenitor of all Succubi, Minagi. While Alma Elma shows absolutely no concern for her species, the succubus race generally have no qualms about not having a leader, due to their desire to be independent. Urban succubi, such as the Succubus Village, also prefer self-government over a mighty queen's reign. Succubi are usually physically defined by demonic horns, tails and bat-like wings, however their biology seems to go a lot further than that. It is shown that Succubi are able to secrete powerful pheromones, radiate seductive auras and morph their body internally, providing a variety of techniques that purely revolve around their internal movements and internal design which can either punish a human or continually drain him in a never-ending ejaculation. It has even been shown that their tails and belly buttons can morph into a variety of orifices to drain men. Interestingly, Succubi seem to only need human semen and spirit energy as a source of food, there has been no example of the monsters breeding directly with humans. However, they do seem to create new generations in a different way, they can use their voluptuous powers to turn human women into fellow Succubi, this is further aided when certain magical powers boost their own. They agree not to kill their \"livestock\" and only drain them until they are severely weak, not that this is seen as a problem for the men.  However, the more powerful succubi generally use these attacks and it is supposed that these are ancient arts of succubus origin, indeed it is shown that the Succubi view sex as not only a means to feed, but an art form in itself, one that they express with much freedom and passion. Goddess Ilias states to detest the succubi the most among all monsters, as they drown in pleasure and make a mockery of life itself. It is also said that Minagi is her most hated monster.]",

Harpies usually live together and have a strong sense of community, often having siblings and even sharing their mate. Currently, the general harpy population resides in Happiness Village under the rule and guidance of their queen, Lucretia. Harpies generally sport brown feathers from the waist down with feathery wing-like ears and some form of downy feathers covering the breasts of younger individuals. It also seems that royal harpies have a much more colorful plumage to communicate their status within the group. Oddly, the harpies of Happiness Village are shown wielding spears and bows, despite the lack of hands (Siren is the only harpy in the game that has hands). In addition to their weaponry, harpies are capable of producing powerful gusts of wind. Seeking to reproduce, they snatch up suitable men and carry them away to their nests to forcibly marry them. A man forced to marry a harpy will be unable to rest, and will spend almost all their time in intercourse with the harpy.\nThis is not a bad fate in itself as harpies also take good care of their chosen husbands, providing highly nutritious food that gives them the stamina and energy to keep up with their new lifestyle. This also enables older husbands to feel and act much younger. Overall, harpies seem content to coexist with humans and as such work with the villagers in Happiness Village, albeit with complications due to extended families. Although they seek to mate with humans and coexist with them, they were previously known to be very war-like. Their previous queen was known to be a ruthless warrior who constantly waged war around the Ilias Continent, and a Cursed Sword user named Desureia was nicknamed the \"Death on Wings\" due to her favoring the Demon Skull Beheading skill.]",

They are a race of divine creatures led by Goddess Ilias, the manifestation of light. The usual form of an angel resembles a human woman with feathered wings and a halo. However, there are many deviations from this. Some angels do not have halos (e.g. Valkyrie), and many of the higher-ranking angels bear monster-like traits. The body of an angel is comprised of holy energy. This composition means that most attacks pass harmlessly through them; a major advantage in battle. The only things that can harm an angel are another angel, pure dark energy-based attacks or the sword Angel Halo, which is made from hundreds of angels. Angel Halo can erode their bodies until they eventually transform into a being of pure holy energy. However, if an angel is a hybrid, i.e. part monster or human, they can be naturally harmed due to these mixed genes. For example, Promestein, a former full angel who gained monster traits due to experimentation. According to chronicles, the angels could be physically harmed at the time of the Great Monster Wars. However, no further explanation was given. An angel's holy power can be fatal to humans exposed to it, causing their bodies to erode until they are transformed into a being of pure energy. It is unknown if this affects monsters, but unlikely due to holy power being naturally incompatible with their dark energies. Angels are also known to have abnormally high regeneration. A fallen angel was said to have used Meditation in order to heal injuries. Like monsters, angels also gain energy from a human`s sperm, and can be impregnated. However, angels do not necessarily need this as an energy source. Angels have the lowest population compared to other races. This is due to many reasons: Ilias having abandoned the creation and development of the angel race, the angels originally being forbidden to have direct contact with humans, the angel forces being inferior to the monsters during the Great Monster Wars, and the angel race being mostly exterminated by the \"Angel Killer\" Heinrich. An angel's lifespan is said to be approximately 10,000 years. Despite being seen as \"good and holy\" figures, they are actually evil and destructive just like their goddess: the angels caused the Slaughter of Remina along with the Chimeras under their goddess’s command, and even fought against Heinrich 500 years prior. Although angels seem to have free will, a majority of them are extremely obedient to Ilias and thus blindly carry out all her commands; in actuality, Ilias shows no care for her own kind and views them as sacrificial and expendable pawns.]",

She is also somewhat reclusive, living in Gold Volcano and rarely interacting with the outside world. Like her fellow Spirits, Salamander gets annoyed with Sylph’s personality, and at one point “Mandy” (as Sylph calls her) sets Sylph's hair on fire to stop her babbling.

Undine believes her power is the most difficult to master (and most sophisticated) and calls the power of fire “simple”, “shallow”, and “barbaric”, which naturally annoys Salamander. Salamander's location was well known amongst monsters, with many visiting her hoping to be made into her apprentice. She mostly declined them. If any dared to challenge her, she would mercilessly attack them and, if the challenger was a human man, she would sexually humiliate them afterwards. Salamander later adopted the young dragon kin Granberia, travelling around the world with her. She taught Granberia swordplay, and Granberia would eventually grow to become more powerful than her adoptive parent. Granberia eventually left to become the Heavenly Knight of Fire, but never lost her respect or gratitude towards Salamander. The spirit of flame has a very prideful and wild disposition.

Using their physical make-up they can achieve many things which other monsters cannot. This ranges from rejuvenation, body alteration, internal flows and changes in the composition of their slime among other skills. As they are not solid, their whole body is essentially an orifice and at the same time lacking in them, simply enveloping the \"important\" parts of their catch and manipulating the slime inside their bodies to make him ejaculate. On the whole, it is suggested that slimes procreate through division, and need semen as some form of catalyst. They seem to have unique textures and temperatures but due to the fact that most are based around water they are all highly susceptible to changes in the environment which they are usually adapted to. When in Undine’s Spring, it is said by Erubetie that the slime race is becoming less and less populated due to the fact that the water around them is being polluted by humanity. This is to say that the slimes cannot live in just any climate, but ones with moist conditions. Erubetie seems to be the only exception to this rule, however as she is a gestalt being formed from many slimes and monsters, she not only carries around a huge amount of magical power but is very much on the borderline of being classed as a slime herself. Slime techniques are usually very simple as attacks generally involve invading or enveloping their prey in their own mass, as the latter is a more reliable way of capturing their food they have a tendency to keep their prey in their body for future feeding. Slimes are also capable of dissolving flesh and bone with their body, and may consume humans this way for their own sadistic enjoyment. Some slimes also have additional abilities, as a Heavenly Knight, Erubetie throws around considerable magical power which can reverse aging and has the ability to divide at will. Green Slime also shows an ability to flood the area with her slime despite being quite small. According to some sources, Slimes that carry a pink color are carnivorous, although there are exceptions such as the Bunny Slime, who acquired her color by eating carrots, and Erubetie, who can digest her victims despite being blue. Also, the density of their color varies depending on how much of their digestive enzymes they have utilized. They are generally weak to vibration attacks and superheat. Any slime that comes into contact with a vibrating object or high temperatures results the mass losing contact from their core body due to their cells being cut and killed. However, some slimes like Lava Girl thrive in heat and actually live in lavas. Thus, Amphisbaena is the ultimate anti-slime weapon. Despite being a race on the verge of extinction and not being as notorious as some other monster races, they are definitely not monsters to be trifled with, even Jelly Girl.]",

The peculiar structure of her spinneret is able to act as both a normal spider’s spinneret and as a female vagina that can force men to ejaculate with surprising ease. She is able to manipulate her spider silk inside her own body as she uses it to stimulate the man. Even after mating with a man for reproductive purposes, she will almost always eat him anyway. There have been cases of a Tarantula Girl keeping a man as a partner for life, though.]",

However, they rape those who do trespass on their lands. Though they use the pretext of punishment, in most cases it’s done for their own pleasure and enjoyment, or even for reproduction. Their sexual skills are very potent; the Queen Elf's power is said to rival a succubus's. Normal elves are vegetarians and do not normally eat semen. However, if they do develop a taste for semen, they go through a process called Degeneration, becoming a dark elf. Dark elves are are generally more aggressive, even more sadistic, have an even greater libido, and are rendered incapable of reproduction. Dark elves are known to corrupt men by using their infamous Kiss of Ecstasy skill to drown him in pleasure and then force him to ejaculate. Once a man gives in to their pleasure, he becomes corrupted just like the dark elf, forgetting everything except pleasure. When this happens, the man may single-mindedly have sex with the dark elf to the point where he may die. Elves are seemingly native to the Forest of Spirits, the Safina region until humans drove them out, and Yamatai Village.

However, Sphinx’s husband eventually grew old and sick; yet he refused his wife’s offer of turning into a monster to prolong his life, because he wished to die as a human. Overcome by grief and sorrow, Sphinx was immersed with loneliness; she had considered turning herself into a human as a means of dying along with her husband, but feared that with her death no one would be left to remember him. Since then, she founded the Dragon Seal Trial, a test that, once taken, supports marriage between human and monster (and by law, dragons can only marry humans who have passed the trial).]",

A Slime Girls as well as a Harpies also live in Grand Noah as citizens, while a Dullahan and a Cerberus serve as royal guards. Additionally, a human male owning the Weapon Shop sells armor only for monsters. The main draw of the city is its massive Colosseum that draws in crowds to see fights take place. Originally it was a place for human warriors to battle, the only serious battles are between monsters, while the human men, unable (or unwilling) to fight back seriously end up getting raped. However, with the fights being a public display there is rarely a case of people being raped to death, though men usually become addicted to the pleasure and return to “fight” over and over again. Another regular face is Kyuba, which is actually a pseudonym for Alma Elma, who comes to fight for fun and to have her fix of men, both of which she loves so much; she also had admitted to hate seeing the Colosseum go away. With the Colosseum mainly drawing men to get their fix of monster sex and the women wanting to watch the men be oppressed by the monsters, the place has become a mere venue for sex shows, much to the dismay of the Grand Noah Queen who wants to restore it to its original honorable use.

Instead, their religion is more based on the folklore which surrounds the monsters. Certain kinds of monsters are worshipped to the extent that the humans in the village have built shrines for them. These monsters are referred to by their animal basis rather than their species name: kitsune being named \"Mighty Fox\", lamias as \"Mighty Snake\" and Nekomatas as \"Mighty Cat\". The worship is so ingrained that such monsters are always referred to formally and with the utmost respect. Even showing an inch of malice towards any of these monsters is frowned upon and is considered to be folly. Generally the shrines house their respective monsters if they are present. Tamamo of the Four Heavenly Knights also hails from this village, and she likes frequenting the Fox Shrine to bask in the attention and be treated to her beloved fried tofu. Other folklore revolves around monsters such as the Yuki-onna and the dreaded Yamata no Orochi, the latter demanding a sacrifice every year to be delivered in her cave.

Notable members are the current queen, Alma Elma, the legendary queens from 500 years ago, Lilith & Lilim, and the Six Ancestor and progenitor of all Succubi, Minagi. While Alma Elma shows absolutely no concern for her species, the succubus race generally have no qualms about not having a leader, due to their desire to be independent. Urban succubi, such as the Succubus Village, also prefer self-government over a mighty queen's reign. Succubi are usually physically defined by demonic horns, tails and bat-like wings, however their biology seems to go a lot further than that. It is shown that Succubi are able to secrete powerful pheromones, radiate seductive auras and morph their body internally, providing a variety of techniques that purely revolve around their internal movements and internal design which can either punish a human or continually drain him in a never-ending ejaculation. It has even been shown that their tails and belly buttons can morph into a variety of orifices to drain men. Interestingly, Succubi seem to only need human semen and spirit energy as a source of food, there has been no example of the monsters breeding directly with humans. However, they do seem to create new generations in a different way, they can use their voluptuous powers to turn human women into fellow Succubi, this is further aided when certain magical powers boost their own. They agree not to kill their \"livestock\" and only drain them until they are severely weak, not that this is seen as a problem for the men.  However, the more powerful succubi generally use these attacks and it is supposed that these are ancient arts of succubus origin, indeed it is shown that the Succubi view sex as not only a means to feed, but an art form in itself, one that they express with much freedom and passion. Goddess Ilias states to detest the succubi the most among all monsters, as they drown in pleasure and make a mockery of life itself. It is also said that Minagi is her most hated monster.]",

Originally planning to spread the previous Monster Lord Alice XV (Fifteenth)'s wishes of coexistence between humans and monsters alike after she sacrificed herself to Marcellus' adventuring party, a young Alice XVI (Sixteenth) went berserk after misinterpreting the events upon seeing her mother's deceased body and murdered both Merlin and Karen, the latter of which was a woman whom both Lazarus and Marcellus loved. Out of pure vengeance, they formed the anti-monster terrorist organization and had forsaken Alice XV's ideals. Alice XVI would later regret sparking these chains of events. Sometime after, Marcellus met and married Lucifina and fathered a son, Luka. Eventually realizing that Merlin and Karen would not have wanted revenge, Marcellus went on to betray the organization's ideals and began to aid monsters behind the scenes, hiding them in Enrika. However, Lazarus eventually found out and, believing that his betrayal also meant betraying Merlin and Karen's memory, attacked his best friend out of anger. Having expected Marcellus to easily evade, he had not seen the attack due to an injury from Alice XVI that left him partially blind, and quickly succumbs to the injury. The death of his best friend would drive Lazarus into grief and despair; he would then lie about Marcellus's death being caused by monsters and continue enforcing the organization.]",

Currently, the general harpy population resides in Happiness Village under the rule and guidance of their queen, Lucretia.

It also seems that royal harpies have a much more colorful plumage to communicate their status within the group. Oddly, the harpies of Happiness Village are shown wielding spears and bows, despite the lack of hands (Siren is the only harpy in the game that has hands). In addition to their weaponry, harpies are capable of producing powerful gusts of wind. Seeking to reproduce, they snatch up suitable men and carry them away to their nests to forcibly marry them. A man forced to marry a harpy will be unable to rest, and will spend almost all their time in intercourse with the harpy.\nThis is not a bad fate in itself as harpies also take good care of their chosen husbands, providing highly nutritious food that gives them the stamina and energy to keep up with their new lifestyle. This also enables older husbands to feel and act much younger. Overall, harpies seem content to coexist with humans and as such work with the villagers in Happiness Village, albeit with complications due to extended families. Although they seek to mate with humans and coexist with them, they were previously known to be very war-like. Their previous queen was known to be a ruthless warrior who constantly waged war around the Ilias Continent, and a Cursed Sword user named Desureia was nicknamed the \"Death on Wings\" due to her favoring the Demon Skull Beheading skill.]",

They are a race of divine creatures led by Goddess Ilias, the manifestation of light. The usual form of an angel resembles a human woman with feathered wings and a halo. However, there are many deviations from this. Some angels do not have halos (e.g. Valkyrie), and many of the higher-ranking angels bear monster-like traits. The body of an angel is comprised of holy energy. This composition means that most attacks pass harmlessly through them; a major advantage in battle. The only things that can harm an angel are another angel, pure dark energy-based attacks or the sword Angel Halo, which is made from hundreds of angels. Angel Halo can erode their bodies until they eventually transform into a being of pure holy energy. However, if an angel is a hybrid, i.e. part monster or human, they can be naturally harmed due to these mixed genes. For example, Promestein, a former full angel who gained monster traits due to experimentation. According to chronicles, the angels could be physically harmed at the time of the Great Monster Wars. However, no further explanation was given. An angel's holy power can be fatal to humans exposed to it, causing their bodies to erode until they are transformed into a being of pure energy. It is unknown if this affects monsters, but unlikely due to holy power being naturally incompatible with their dark energies. Angels are also known to have abnormally high regeneration. A fallen angel was said to have used Meditation in order to heal injuries. Like monsters, angels also gain energy from a human`s sperm, and can be impregnated. However, angels do not necessarily need this as an energy source. Angels have the lowest population compared to other races. This is due to many reasons: Ilias having abandoned the creation and development of the angel race, the angels originally being forbidden to have direct contact with humans, the angel forces being inferior to the monsters during the Great Monster Wars, and the angel race being mostly exterminated by the \"Angel Killer\" Heinrich. An angel's lifespan is said to be approximately 10,000 years. Despite being seen as \"good and holy\" figures, they are actually evil and destructive just like their goddess: the angels caused the Slaughter of Remina along with the Chimeras under their goddess’s command, and even fought against Heinrich 500 years prior. Although angels seem to have free will, a majority of them are extremely obedient to Ilias and thus blindly carry out all her commands; in actuality, Ilias shows no care for her own kind and views them as sacrificial and expendable pawns.]",

Using their physical make-up they can achieve many things which other monsters cannot. This ranges from rejuvenation, body alteration, internal flows and changes in the composition of their slime among other skills. As they are not solid, their whole body is essentially an orifice and at the same time lacking in them, simply enveloping the \"important\" parts of their catch and manipulating the slime inside their bodies to make him ejaculate. On the whole, it is suggested that slimes procreate through division, and need semen as some form of catalyst. They seem to have unique textures and temperatures but due to the fact that most are based around water they are all highly susceptible to changes in the environment which they are usually adapted to. When in Undine’s Spring, it is said by Erubetie that the slime race is becoming less and less populated due to the fact that the water around them is being polluted by humanity. This is to say that the slimes cannot live in just any climate, but ones with moist conditions. Erubetie seems to be the only exception to this rule, however as she is a gestalt being formed from many slimes and monsters, she not only carries around a huge amount of magical power but is very much on the borderline of being classed as a slime herself. Slime techniques are usually very simple as attacks generally involve invading or enveloping their prey in their own mass, as the latter is a more reliable way of capturing their food they have a tendency to keep their prey in their body for future feeding. Slimes are also capable of dissolving flesh and bone with their body, and may consume humans this way for their own sadistic enjoyment. Some slimes also have additional abilities, as a Heavenly Knight, Erubetie throws around considerable magical power which can reverse aging and has the ability to divide at will. Green Slime also shows an ability to flood the area with her slime despite being quite small. According to some sources, Slimes that carry a pink color are carnivorous, although there are exceptions such as the Bunny Slime, who acquired her color by eating carrots, and Erubetie, who can digest her victims despite being blue. Also, the density of their color varies depending on how much of their digestive enzymes they have utilized. They are generally weak to vibration attacks and superheat. Any slime that comes into contact with a vibrating object or high temperatures results the mass losing contact from their core body due to their cells being cut and killed. However, some slimes like Lava Girl thrive in heat and actually live in lavas. Thus, Amphisbaena is the ultimate anti-slime weapon.

Her following was stronger in more southerly regions, with the southernmost continent bearing her name and having many locations named for her. Initially, Ilias also forbade humans from using technology, even fire. One of Ilias' angels, Promestein, broke this rule and taught humans to use fire, for which Ilias sentenced her to centuries of imprisonment. However, Ilias continued to desire the destruction of monsters. She sent Heroes, such as the legendary Heinrich, to go on quests to destroy the current Monster Lord and defeat any monsters they encounter on their way. In return for their “unwavering service,” she gave them her blessing at a coming-of-age ritual, which is said to protect heroes by making their semen taste like angel liver.

She wields magic ability far more potent than any other mortal monster as well as great physical strength. Alice may manipulate her lower body in a variety of abnormal and often unsightly ways, often revealing tentacles, an ability likely exclusive to Monster Lords. Alice possesses extreme physical strength as well as dangerous magic, namely Omega Blaze, Frost Ozma, and Monster Lord’s Cruelty. She is also very analytical and adaptable to most situations, allowing her to read her opponent’s abilities and tactics and then use that knowledge to turn the tables in her favor. In addition, she is capable of inflicting numerous status ailments through her eyes, causing Luka to call her a “walking altered status machine.” She is also capable of teleportation, telepathy, and flight. Her sexual skill is also proven to be top-notch, using every part of her body to rape a man and bring him to ecstasy within a matter of seconds. Despite the fact that Alice had an unpleasant experience with the people who killed her mother, despite the fact that her mother Alice the 15th herself wanted it, she feels neutral towards people. All this is due to the upbringing of Tamamo, who was able to stop some of her childhood traumas and now she is more calm and prudent.]",
